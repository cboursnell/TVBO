Adding actions for addons are all in the 'Buildings' drop down menu.
From here you can add new addons, lift and land buildings. When you
add a new addon you need to specify what building you want it to be
built on. Right-click on the action and select the name of the prod-
uction building from the popup box that appears. Then move the action
to where you want in the time line.

To swap addons around you can add the Lift and Land actions from the
building menu. Right-click on the Lift or Land actions to set the
addon you want. You can land a building on the ground not next to
an addon by selecting the 'none' option.
