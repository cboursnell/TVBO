Adding actions for addons are all in the 'Buildings' drop down menu.
From here you can add new addons, lift and land buildings. When you
add a new addon you need to specify what building you want it to be
built on. Select the action, click the square in the lower right
corner and select the name of the production building from the popup
box that appears. Then move the action to where you want in the time
line.

To swap addons around you can add the Lift and Land actions from the
building menu.
